REM Tested on ChromeOS 114.0.5735.177 . This might not work perfectly for other versions and could require a little tweaking, especially with delays depending on computer and network connection.
REM Wait to execute this script when you see the initial login screen. Don't click your mouse or touch anything- the "Get Started" button is automatically highlighted on boot.
REM This script obviously requires modification to work! Any lines that end in "!!!" mean that it is absolutely necessary to edit them for this to work. Check surrounding comments for an explanation of what it is for. Delete all text following "STRING" and replace with your own.
REM This first delay is very important!! When the Chromebook boots, it will receive USB keyboard input before it is ready to be worked on. Adjust this to a long delay that accommodates the time it takes to boot into the setup screen. Or, leave it to a short delay if you have something like a Flipper Zero that can chose when to execute the script with the push of a button.

REM This ugly repetitive section is to navigate to "Add other Wifi network". This cannot selected through conventional "tabbing". Don't worry, it's at the bottom of the list, and it won't deselect if you press "down" too many times. Feel free to remove the delays, but a handful of chromebooks didn't want to register all the down keypresses without them. Also, if you have a lot of other networks within range, consider adding more downs. Another note, selecting the actual network you want to connect to from the list directly is a bad idea since the RSSI can change at any point, shifting its position in the list.

REM Wait a longggg time for it to finish enrolling. The "ENTER" is totally optional and the chromebook is considered enrolled after the loading screen without further input. However, for convenience sake, I have left this in, but feel free to remove it.
